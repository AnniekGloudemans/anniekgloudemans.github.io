As a part of the sustainability committee at the Leiden Observatory in The Netherlands, we have developed a 5-day lesson program designed for primary school students (9-12 years old). The main aim of this project is to fascinate children about the Universe and make them realise how unique our Earth and climate are from a cosmic perspective. Education about the climate crisis is an urgent topic on the Sustainable Development Goals agenda and highly relevant for schools in the Netherlands. Astronomy is a powerful tool to fascinate children about our Universe and offers a new perspective on the climate discussion by making them realise how unique our Earth is compared to other uninhabitable planets and why we have to protect it.

The idea is that we achieve our goals through play. The children work in groups, over the course of 5 lessons. Each group is assigned to a planet or moon in the Solar System and is asked to design and to build an alien that can live on it (based on a workshop from AstroEdu). For the first part of their activity they will be actively gathering information about the planet/moon assigned to them. Once they know enough, they will start the design and construction of the aliens. For the second part of the activity, once the aliens are finished, they will then have to test the survivability of their alien using testing stations to mimic for example cold, wind, or high gravity.

Our pilot project has been very successful and with the support from the ET Outreach award (URL) we have been able to further develop the lesson material, which will be made available online for everyone to use in the near future (see https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/leven-in-het-heelal/over-leven ).
