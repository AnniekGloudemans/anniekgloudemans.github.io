I am an observational astronomer and currently finishing my PhD at Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands, advised by Prof. Huub Rottgering and Dr. Kenneth Duncan. My fascination for observational astronomy has lead me to many different research projects ranging from Lunar surface exploration to observations of the most distant galaxies in our Universe. As a member of the WEAVE-LOFAR team and LOFAR surveys, my main research interest is in studying the formation and evolution of distant radio-loud quasars in the early Universe using the latest low-frequency radio surveys and multi-wavelength facilities. I have a passion for science communication and public outreach for which astronomy is a great tool. Check out my research and outreach page if you are interested in my work.
