Supporting Early Career Astronomers 
======

To promote EDI in astronomy, mental health, and career development of early career astronomers (ECA) we have collected resources and organise yearly ECA meetings at the European Astronomical Society Annual Meeting (EAS). The goal of these meetings is to connect early career astronomers and learn how to thrive in an academic environment.

These are some resources we have gathered from the talks and discussions at the EAS Annual Meeting Session SS31: Early Career Astronomers and their Supporters:
